# bun-ffi-rust

This is a small experiment using [bun](https://bun.sh) to call Rust code 'directly' from TypeScript.
To learn more, check out the [blog post](https://jotoh.dev/blog/call-rust-from-typescript-with-bun/).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run main.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
